## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing documents using Large Language Models (LLMs). The goal is to extract, interpret, and understand information from a document, specifically Google's Terms of Service. The approach can be easily adapted to other document types and domains.

## Required Libraries
- pdfplumber (for extracting text from PDF)
- transformers (for using pre-trained LLM models)
- nltk (for text processing)
- pandas (for data handling)
- torch (backend for transformers)

## Installation Requirements
```
pip install pdfplumber transformers nltk pandas torch
```

## Data Requirements
- PDF document (Google Terms of Service)
- Download link provided in the article

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Extract Text from PDF
- Use pdfplumber to open and read text from each page of the PDF
- Save the extracted text to a .txt file for further analysis

### Step 2: Preview the Extracted Text
- Display a portion of the extracted text to verify successful extraction

### Step 3: Summarize the Document
- Use a pre-trained summarization model (t5-small)
- Set up the summarization pipeline
- Apply the model to the document text with appropriate parameters
- Display the generated summary

### Step 4: Split the Document into Sentences and Passages
- Use NLTK's sent_tokenize() to split the document into individual sentences
- Combine sentences into manageable passages (200 words per passage)
- This helps ensure each passage is of suitable length for further processing

### Step 5: Generate Questions from Passages
- Use a question generation model (T5-based model valhalla/t5-base-qg-hl)
- Generate at least three questions for each passage
- If fewer than three questions are generated, split the passage into smaller parts
- Display the generated questions along with corresponding passages

### Step 6: Answer Generated Questions
- Use a pre-trained question-answering model (deepset/roberta-base-squad2)
- Track unique questions to avoid answering duplicates
- Generate answers based on the context of each passage
- Display questions and their corresponding answers

## Expected Output
- Extracted text from the PDF document
- Document summary
- List of passages with generated questions
- Questions with their corresponding answers
